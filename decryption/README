The source of this problem is one of the live demo in CS221 lectures by
Percy Liang (Stanford University). Most of the utility function and general
Structure of the code is borrow from Prof. Liangs implementation.

Implementation of Forward backward Algorithm (for inference on HMM)
has been developed independently.

The goal of this experiment is to solve simple substitution cipher.
The problem is set up as a Hidden-Markov-Model, where the latent vari-
able represent the plain english characters and observed variables
represent the encrypted characters. Transition probabilities correspond
to bi-gram frequencies and emission probabilities corresponds to mapping
between the english characters and corresonding substitution.
